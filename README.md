# BookWebScraping

**Part 2 of book scraping**

In this software I created a website(localhost) using Java, Spring Boot, and apache tomcat.

After collecting some books from part 1, this software connects to the database and builds html page viewing available books that were collected from 
"https://openlibrary.org/".

User can download the book to its own device and read the book. Also I did searching functionality with autocomplete.
